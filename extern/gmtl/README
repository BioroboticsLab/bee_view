| What is GMTL?
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  The Generic Math Template Library (GMTL) is a high-performance, extensible,
  and generic math library. The design is based upon discussion with many
  experts in the field of computer graphics and virtual reality, culminating the
  efforts of many previous math library efforts. GMTL gives the graphics
  programmer several core math types and a rich library of graphics/math
  operations on those types.


o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o
| Requirements
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  There are several requirements necessary to compile and use GMTL. Here is a
  list of the minimum requirements.

    * A standards comformant C++ compiler with good template support
    * SCons 0.96

  If you wish to compile and use the tests in GMTL, you will also need the
  following:

    * CppUnit 1.9.11

| Installation
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  Much like the Standard Template Library, GMTL is completely comprised of
  header files. Thus there is no compilation step needed to build any libraries.
 
  In order to install GMTL to /usr/local, use the following command. This will
  install gmtl-config to /usr/local/bin and the associated header files to
  /usr/local/include.

       # cd <GMTL_HOME>
       # scons install

  If you wish to install GMTL to an alternate location, such as your home
  directory, use the prefix option.

       $ cd <GMTL_HOME>
       $ scons install prefix=$HOME

  This will install GMTL to the appropriate locations relative to $HOME -- that
  is, the gmtl-config script will be installed to $HOME/bin and the associated
  header files to $HOME/include.
