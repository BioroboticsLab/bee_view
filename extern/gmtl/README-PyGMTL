| What is PyGMTL?
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  The Python bindings for Generic Math Template Library (GMTL), a
  high-performance, extensible, and generic math library.  The GMTL design is
  based upon discussion with many experts in the field of computer graphics
  and virtual reality, culminating the efforts of many previous math library
  efforts.  GMTL gives the graphics programmer several core math types and a
  rich library of graphics/math operations on those types.  PyGMTL provides
  access to all of this through Python.

| Requirements
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  There are several requirements necessary to compile and use PyGMTL.  Here is
  a list of the minimum requirements.

    * A standards comformant C++ compiler with good template support
       - To compile PyGMTL on Windows, Visual C++ 7.1 (part of Visual
         Studio .NET 2003) or newer is required
    * SCons 0.96
    * Python 2.2 or newer
    * Boost.Python v2 compiled and installed from Boost 1.31.0 or newer

| Installation
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  While GMTL is comprised completely of header files, PyGMTL must be compiled
  into a dynamically loadable Python extension module.  In order compile
  PyGMTL, use the following command.  The value for <BOOST_PYTHON_HOME> must
  be the directory where Boost.Python v2 was installed, and the value for
  <BOOST_VERSION> must be the version of Boost (e.g., 1.31, 1.32, etc.).

       # cd <GMTL_HOME>
       # scons optimize=yes EnablePython=True \
            BoostPythonDir=<BOOST_PYTHON_HOME> BoostVersion=<BOOST_VERSION>

  Once PyGMTL is compiled, the Python extension module will be in the
  'python' subdirectory.  Its name is platform-specific.  The following
  shows some likely names depending on the operating system:

      * UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X: gmtl.so
      * Windows: gmtl.pyd

  Copy the PyGMTL Python extension module to a logical place where Python
  will be able to find it.  On Windows, the easiest place to put the file
  is in the Python installation directory.  On UNIX-based platforms, it
  can be placed into <PYTHON_ROOT>/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.  Otherwise,
  it can be placed into a subdirectory of the user's home directory such
  as $HOME/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages.  In that case, the environment
  variable $PYTHONPATH must be set in order for Python to be able to find
  PyGMTL at run time.

| Documentation
o------------------------------------------------------------------------------o

  A FAQ, API reference, and programmer's guide are available on GMTL's web
  site.  The PyGMTL API corresponds very closely with the GMTL C++ API,
  though there are differences since Python does not support templates.
