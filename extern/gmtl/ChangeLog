                        example, "origin" instead of "mOrigin").  The modified
                        classes are gmtl.AABox*, gmtl.Coord*, gmtl.Plane*,
                        gmtl.Quat*, gmtl.Ray*, and gmtl.Sphere*.

2002-06-12 subatomic    EulerAngle is templatized on RotationOrder now.
                        This means that EulerXYZ and EulerZYX are discrete types
                        which will allow the benefit of type safety and compile 
                        time optimization.

                        Changed to set() and make() naming on functions
                        that were actually set (like setRot(quat,axisangle)

                        set(anytype, anyothertype) and make<anytype>(anyother).
                        Coord is now templatized on POS_TYPE, ROT_TYPE.

                        built-in primitive types.

                        etc...) to work around compilers that dont support
                        these trig functions.
2002-05-17 subatomic    Doxygen: grouped everything into "modules", logical 
                        groupings that make the reference guide much easier
